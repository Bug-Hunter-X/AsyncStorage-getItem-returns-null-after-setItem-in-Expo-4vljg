This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo.  The problem is that AsyncStorage.setItem is asynchronous, meaning it doesn't immediately return the result of the operation.  If you try to access the stored item immediately after calling setItem, it might not be available yet, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
AsyncStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('key'); // value might be null
console.log(value);
```
